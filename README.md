## 📌 About

Hi, I’m **Debananda Kunar**.  
I started learning JavaScript recently and built this repository to keep track of my learning journey.  

The goal is:  
- To document my progress  
- To share structured notes with examples  
- To make it easier for beginners (including myself) to revise concepts quickly  

If you find this helpful, feel free to use it, improve it, or contribute.

- Arrays and objects  
- DOM manipulation  
- Events  
- ES6+ features (arrow functions, classes, destructuring, modules, etc.)  
- Asynchronous JS: callbacks, promises, async/await  
- Error handling  
- Practice notes & small code snippets
